# Items-Order-Case
### Situation:
Developed a SQL project to manage and analyze data for an e-commerce platform with two tables: orders and customers. The project involved complex queries using various SQL functions, operators, and clauses to derive insights and manage data efficiently.

### Task:
Utilized DDL and DML Commands, Date Functions, Comparison Operators, LIKE Operator, DISTINCT Statement, Aggregate Functions, Group By, HAVING Clause, Aliases, Order By, IN and NOT IN, BETWEEN Operator, and Inner Join.

### Action:
#### 1. Data Preparation
-Converted order_date (text) to OrderDate (date).
#### 2. Comparison Operators
-Retrieved items purchased by customer 10449.<br>
-Selected all orders for customers who bought a Tent.<br>
-Extracted items starting with 'S'.<br>
-Listed unique items using DISTINCT.
#### 3. Aggregate Functions
-Found maximum item price.<br>
-Calculated average price for December orders.<br>
-Counted total rows in orders.<br>
-Determined lowest price for tents.
#### 4. Group By Clause
-Counted customers per state.<br>
-Retrieved max and min price per item.<br>
-Summarized orders per customer.
#### 5. HAVING Clause
-Identified states with more than one customer.<br>
-Filtered items with a max price over 190.<br>
-Listed customers with more than one order.
#### 6. Order By Clause
-Sorted customers by last name.<br>
-Ordered items by price.
#### 7. Combining Conditions & Boolean Operators
-Filtered out 'Snow Shoes' and 'Ear Muffs'.<br>
-Selected items starting with 'S', 'P', or 'F'.
#### 8. IN & BETWEEN
-Selected items priced between 10 and 80.<br>
-Filtered customers from specific states.
#### 9. Mathematical Functions
-Calculated per unit price for each item.
#### 10. Table Joins
-Joined customers and orders tables to list items purchased by each customer, sorted by state.

### Result:
Successfully executed complex SQL queries demonstrating proficiency in SQL operations and data handling.
